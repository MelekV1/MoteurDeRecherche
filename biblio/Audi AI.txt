Audi AG est un constructeur d'automobiles, sportives et de luxe allemand, filiale du groupe Volkswagen appelé VAG (Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft) qui détient la marque à 99,55 %. Le siège social se situe à Ingolstadt en Bavière. Implanté dans 55 pays du monde, Audi est présent sur la plupart des segments du marché des véhicules particuliers, y compris sur celui des sportives de prestiges grâce à ses deux filiales que sont Lamborghini et Audi Sport. En 2012, l’entreprise a vendu 1 524 635 véhicules, un record depuis sa création en 1909, et se classe parmi les constructeurs les plus rentables.

Le nom « Audi » est un jeu de mots entre « audi » (entends ou écoute en latin) et le patronyme du fondateur August Horch (écoute en allemand) qui crée l’entreprise le 16 juillet 1909. Déjà constructeur d’automobiles à vocation sportive à cette époque, l’entreprise connaît des difficultés financières qui l’obligent à fusionner en 1932 avec trois autres marques automobiles saxonnes. La nouvelle entité dénommée Auto Union est représentée par quatre anneaux, identité visuelle conservée aujourd’hui encore par Audi. En 1964, Volkswagen AG rachète Auto Union et ressuscite le nom Audi. Ce n’est qu’à partir des années 1970, sous l’impulsion de Ferdinand Piëch, qu’Audi rencontre l’essor qu’on lui connaît aujourd’hui.
Audi AI
Audi AI is a driver assist feature offered by Audi. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving at a future time, acknowledging that legal, regulatory and technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal. On June 4, 2017, Audi stated that its new A8 will be fully self-driving for speeds up to 60 km/h using its Audi AI. Contrary to other cars, the driver will not have to do safety checks such as touching the steering wheel every 15 seconds to use this feature. The Audi A8 will therefore be the first production car to reach level 3 autonomous driving, meaning that the driver can safely turn their attention away from driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. Audi will also be the first manufacturer to use a 3D LIDAR system in addition to cameras and ultrasonic sensors for their AI.
Prior to the introduction of the Audi 80 and Audi 50 in 1972 and 1974, respectively, Audi had led the development of the EA111 and EA827 inline-four engine families. These new power units underpinned the water-cooled revival of parent company Volkswagen (in the Polo, Golf, Passat and Scirocco), whilst the many derivatives and descendants of these two basic engine designs have appeared in every generation of VW Group vehicles right up to the present day.

In the 1980s, Audi, along with Volvo, was the champion of the inline-five cylinder, 2.1/2.2 L engine as a longer-lasting alternative to more traditional six-cylinder engines. This engine was used not only in production cars but also in their race cars. The 2.1 L inline five-cylinder engine was used as a base for the rally cars in the 1980s, providing well over 400 horsepower (300 kilowatts) after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0 L and 2.3 L. This range of engine capacity allowed for both fuel economy and power.

For the ultra-luxury version of its Audi A8 fullsize luxury flagship sedan, the Audi A8L W12, Audi uses the Volkswagen Group W12 engine instead of the conventional V12 engine favored by rivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The W12 engine configuration (also known as a "WR12") is created by forming two imaginary narrow-angle 15° VR6 engines at an angle of 72°, and the narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two overhead camshafts to drive each pair of banks, so just four are needed in total. The advantage of the W12 engine is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional V12 engine could have only a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, the 6.0 L W12 in the Audi A8L W12 is smaller in overall dimensions than the 4.2 L V8 that powers the Audi A8 4.2 variants.[61] The 2011 Audi A8 debuted a revised 6.3-litre version of the W12 (WR12) engine with 500 PS (370 kW; 490 hp).

Fuel Stratified Injection
New models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the ageing 1.8-litre engine now having been replaced by new Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) engines. Nearly every petroleum burning model in the range now incorporates this fuel-saving technology.
Direct-Shift Gearbox
In 2003 Volkswagen introduced the Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG), a type of dual clutch transmission. It is a semi-automatic transmission, drivable like a conventional automatic transmission. Based on the gearbox found in the Group B S1, the system includes dual electro hydraulically controlled clutches instead of a torque converter. This is implemented in some VW Golfs, Audi A3, Audi A4 and TT models where DSG is called S-tronic
