Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors, Inc.), is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California.[9] The company specializes in electric vehicle manufacturing, battery energy storage from home to grid scale and, through its acquisition of SolarCity, solar panel and solar roof tile manufacturing.[10]

Tesla operates multiple production and assembly plants, such as: its main vehicle manufacturing facility at Tesla Factory[11] in Fremont, California; Giga Nevada[12] near Reno, Nevada; Giga New York in Buffalo, New York; and Giga Shanghai in Shanghai, China.

As of 2020, Tesla sells Model S,[13] Model 3,[14] Model X,[15] and Model Y[16] cars. Tesla also sells Powerwall,[17] Powerpack,[18] and Megapack[19] batteries, solar panels,[20] solar roof tiles,[21] and some related products.[22]

Tesla Motors was founded in July 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. The next three employees were Ian Wright, Elon Musk, and J. B. Straubel, all of whom are retroactively allowed to call themselves co-founders of the company.[2] Musk, who formerly served as chairman and is the current CEO, said that he envisioned Tesla Motors as a technology company and independent automaker, aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer. In February 2017, Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla.

After 11 years in the market, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling plug-in as well as best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer by cars sold in 2019, both as a brand and by automotive group, with a market share of 17% of the plug-in segment and 23% of the battery electric segment.[23] Tesla global vehicle sales increased 50% from 245,240 units in 2018[24] to 367,849 units in 2019.[23] On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car.[25] As of March 2020, the Model 3 ranks as the world's all-time best-selling plug-in electric car, with more than 500,000 delivered.[26]

Tesla has never had a profitable year;[27] however, it has had several individually profitable quarters, most recently the quarters ending September 2018, December 2018, September 2019, December 2019, and March 2020.[28]

On February 20, 2020, Tesla reached a market capitalization of US$166 billion.
Tesla's business strategy is to emulate typical technological-product life cycles and initially target affluent buyers, and then move into larger markets at lower price points.[43][51] The battery and electric drivetrain technology for each model would be developed and partially paid for through the sales of earlier models.[43][52] The Roadster was low-volume and priced at US$109,000. Model S and Model X target the broader luxury market. Model 3 and the Model Y are aimed at a higher-volume segment.[42][53] This business strategy is common in the technology industry.[54] According to a Musk blog post, "New technology in any field takes a few versions to optimize before reaching the mass market, and in this case it is competing with 150 years and trillions of dollars spent on gasoline cars."[55]

Tesla's production strategy includes a high degree of vertical integration[56] (80% in 2016[57]), which includes component production and proprietary charging infrastructure. The company operates large factories to capture economies of scale. Vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers,[58] and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.

esla's sales strategy is to sell its vehicles online and in company-owned showrooms rather than through a conventional dealer network. Moving towards an e-commerce strategy, customers are able to customize and order their vehicles online.[62][63] (Tesla has built electric powertrain components for vehicles from other automakers, including the Smart ED2 ForTwo electric drive (the lowest-priced car from Daimler AG), the Toyota RAV4 EV, and Freightliner's Custom Chassis Electric Van.)

Tesla's technology strategy focuses on pure-electric propulsion technology, and transferring other approaches from the technology industry to transportation, such as online software updates.[64] Tesla allows its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith.[65] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[66] Tesla retained control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.
Sales
Tesla delivered 367,500 cars in 2019, 50% more than in 2018 and more than triple the number sold in 2017. At the end of 2019, Tesla's global sales since 2012 totaled over 891,000 units.[73][74][75] As of October 2018, Tesla's sales represented about 20% of the all-electric cars on the world's roads, according to Navigant Research.[76] By November 2018, Tesla vehicles had traveled 10 billion miles (16 billion km)
