Dark is a German science fiction thriller web television series co-created by Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese.[5][6][7] Set in the fictitious town of Winden, Germany, Dark concerns the aftermath of a child's disappearance which exposes the secrets of, and hidden connections among, four estranged families as they slowly unravel a sinister time travel conspiracy which spans three generations. Throughout the series, Dark explores the existential implications of time and its effects upon human nature.

Dark is the first ever German language Netflix original series; it debuted on Netflix's streaming service on 1 December 2017. The first season was received with positive reviews from critics, who made initial comparisons to another Netflix series, Stranger Things.[8][9][10]

Netflix recommissioned Dark for a second season, which was released on 21 June 2019 to critical acclaim.[11][12] Prior to the release of season 2, the series was recommissioned for a third and final season which is set to be released on 27 June 2020.
Premise
Children start vanishing from the German town of Winden,[15] bringing to light the fractured relationships, double lives, and dark past of four families living there, and revealing a mystery that spans four generations. The series follows Jonas Kahnwald, a teenager struggling to cope with his father's suicide; police officer Ulrich Nielsen, whose brother disappeared 33 years earlier; and police chief Charlotte Doppler.

The story begins in 2019, but spreads to include story-lines in 1986 and 1953 via time travel, as certain characters of the show's core families grow aware of the existence of a wormhole in the cave system beneath the local nuclear power plant, which is under the management of the influential Tiedemann family. During the first season, secrets begin to be revealed concerning the Kahnwald, Nielsen, Doppler, and Tiedemann families, and their lives start to crumble as the ties become evident between the missing children and the histories of the town and its citizens.

The second season continues the intertwining families' attempts to reunite with their missing loved ones, several months after the first-season finale, in 2020, 1987 and 1954, respectively. Additional story-lines set in 2053 and 1921 add new aspects to the mysteries, and the secret Sic Mundus fellowship, a major force in an underlying battle for the ultimate fate of the people of Winden, is explored, as the season counts down towards the apocalypse – a supposed destruction of Winden and death of many of its citizens.

Cast and characters
The first season primarily takes place in 2019 but expands to include stories set in 1986, 1953, and – in the final scene of the season – 2052, with several characters being portrayed at various ages by multiple actors.

The second season takes place several months after the first, depicting the initial stories in 2020, 1987, and 1954, respectively, while continuing the future-set story-line into 2053, and adding a fifth story-line, set in 1921.
Production
Netflix approved the series in February 2016 for a first season consisting of ten one-hour episodes.[17][5] Principal photography started on 18 October 2016 in and around Berlin[18] (including Saarmund and Tremsdorf in Brandenburg),[19] and ended in March 2017.[5] The church where Jonas meets Noah was filmed at the Südwestkirchhof Cemetery in Stahnsdorf. The high school location was filmed at the Reinfelder Schule in Berlin's Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf neighborhood. The bridge and the train tracks were filmed the middle of the Düppeler forest near Lake Wannsee.[20] The Winden cave entrance is not a real location, but was built as a set.[citation needed]

The series was filmed in 4K (Ultra HD) resolution.[21] It is the first German-language Netflix original series and follows a trend of internationally produced Netflix originals, including the Mexican series Club de Cuervos in 2015, the Brazilian series 3% in 2016, and the Italian series Suburra: Blood on Rome in 2017.

Principal photography for the second season took place on location in Berlin from June 2018.[22]

Filming for the third season began in May 2019 and wrapped in December 2019.[23]

The series created a buzz in the Swiss town of Olten, as Winden's coat of arms closely resembles Olten's. Also, the director's father worked at the Gösgen Nuclear Power Plant not far from Olten.

Release
The first season of the series was released on 1 December 2017.

A second season was announced with a short teaser on the German Facebook pages of the series and Netflix on 20 December 2017.[24][25] On 26 April 2019, it was announced that the second season would premiere on 21 June 2019.[12]

On 26 May 2020, the third and last season had its release date announced to be on 27 June 2020.[26]

Reception
The first season received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many noting its similarity to the 1990s TV series Twin Peaks and the 2016 Netflix series Stranger Things. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 89%, with an average rating of 7.14 out of 10 based on 44 critics, with the "Certified Fresh" status. The site's critical consensus is "Dark's central mystery unfolds slowly, both tense and terrifying, culminating in a creepy, cinematic triumph of sci-fi noir."[27] The series was praised for its tone, the complexity of its narrative, and its pacing.[10] Metacritic reported a score of 67 out of 100 based on 14 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[28] Many claimed that it was darker and more in-depth than Stranger Things.[8] However, there was some criticism of its heavy-handed approach to its message, the lack of sympathetic characters, and the unoriginality of certain aspects of the series.[9]

The second season received critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream publications, the season received an average score of 82, based on 4 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[29] On Rotten Tomatoes, season 2 of the series holds an approval rating of 100% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.07/10, with the "Certified Fresh" status. The site's critical consensus states, "Dark's sumptuous second season descends deeper into the show's meticulously-crafted mythos and cements the series as one of streaming's strongest and strangest science fiction stories."[30] On its first week of release on Netflix, the series topped IMDb's TVmeter. Critics referred to season 2 as ominous and much more bizarre than the first season.[31] Critics are also now saying that the series has managed to subvert several tropes regarding the concepts of time travel.[32]
